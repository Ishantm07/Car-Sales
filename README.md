Car Sales Data Analysis 🚗📊
This project analyzes car sales data to extract meaningful insights, such as pricing trends, vehicle specifications, and market distribution. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the notebook explores various aspects of the dataset, including:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values and formatting data.
- Descriptive Statistics: Understanding key metrics like average price, engine size, and fuel efficiency.
- Visualization: Generating plots to analyze market trends and distributions.
- Filtering & Data Manipulation: Removing specific categories (e.g., non-US cars) and exploring drivetrain types.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset includes 432 rows and 15 columns, covering features like:
- Vehicle Information: Make, Model, Type, Origin, and DriveTrain.
- Pricing: MSRP (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price) and Invoice Price.
- Specifications: Engine Size, Cylinders, Horsepower, MPG (City & Highway), Weight, Wheelbase, and Length.
